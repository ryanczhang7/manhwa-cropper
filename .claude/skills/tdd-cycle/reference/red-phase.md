# RED: writing tests that mean something

## Pick the level that can actually falsify the claim

- **Unit** - where the logic lives. Fast, precise, most of your tests. A pure
  function, a reducer, a rule, a parser.
- **Integration** - where a contract lives. Two of your own components, or one
  of yours and a real dependency (a database, a file format, a renderer).
- **End-to-end** - the handful of paths a user genuinely walks. Expensive and
  flaky in proportion to their number; keep them few and keep them real.

Do not test through three layers what one layer can prove. Do not unit-test a
function whose only interesting behaviour is the integration.

## Name tests after behaviour

The name is read when it fails, by someone who has lost the context.

- Bad: `test_calculate`, `it works`, `renders correctly`
- Good: `rejects a region whose borders do not close`
- Good: `keeps the seed stable when the world is reloaded`

## Cover the shape of the problem

For each acceptance criterion, ask:

- **Zero, one, many** - empty input, a single element, a realistic collection
- **Boundaries** - the value at the limit, and either side of it
- **Errors** - what should happen when it goes wrong, stated as a behaviour
  ("returns a validation error naming the field"), not "it throws something"
- **Non-goals** - where the story's Out of scope section is cheap to pin down,
  pin it down
- **Invariants** - what must remain true regardless of input; property-based
  tests earn their keep here

## Watch it fail

Run the tests. Read the output. Ask: if someone deleted the feature, would this
test go red? If someone subtly broke it - flipped a comparison, dropped a side
effect - would this test go red? If the answer is no, the test is theatre.

Common false RED: an import error. The suite is red because the module does not
exist, not because your assertion is unsatisfied. That is acceptable only for
the very first test of a new module, and only if the next run - after the module
exists but is empty - is red for your actual assertion.

It has a second consequence, and it is the one that gets missed: while the file
does not load, **no assertion in it has run at all**. Tests that take no
production import - a negative control over a synthetic field, a metric applied
to a fixture - are as unexecuted as the rest, and they are the tests everything
else in the suite leans on. A control that silently measures the wrong thing
makes a threshold look calibrated and prove nothing.

So drive your controls outside the framework while the import is still missing:
a plain interpreter, a small script, the helper called directly. Write helpers
so this is possible - a control helper that imports nothing from the source tree
can be run before the source tree exists. Then put the numbers in the handoff:

| Control | Threshold | Expected | Measured in RED |
|---|---|---|---|
| white noise | > 2 continents | 0-1 | 0.6 |
| single blob | > 2 continents | 1 | 1.0 |

Those numbers are a claim until GREEN runs the same controls against the shipped
module and confirms them. Say in the handoff that confirming them is GREEN's
job, because it is the only phase that can.

## When a test passes the moment you write it

Usually this means the test is theatre, and the rule is to delete it or fix it.

There is one honest exception: a **regression guard for an invariant an earlier
story already established** - an import boundary, a lint rule, a schema
constraint, a migration that already ran. The mechanism works, so the guard is
green on arrival; deleting it leaves the mechanism untested, and somebody can
remove the rule later with nothing going red.

Keep such a test only if it earns it, one of two ways:

- **Probe the mechanism.** Break what the rule guards - or the rule's own
  configuration - watch the test go red, and revert. This is the `## Gate
  probes` discipline from the `quality-gates` skill applied to a test, and it
  is the stronger of the two. Prefer it whenever the story owns the rule.
- **Ship a negative control.** Assert the same offending construct is *accepted*
  where the rule does not apply and *rejected* where it does. One test without
  the other proves only that the tool rejects things; the pair is what proves
  the rule is specific to the boundary it claims to defend.

Both must exercise the real gate command. A linter invoked through a
convenience API is not the gate: `biome lint --stdin-file-path` ignores
`overrides`, so a path-scoped rule reports no diagnostic and exit 0 for a file
the real gate rejects. Write a real file, run the real command, delete the file.

Then say so in the handoff: which tests passed on arrival, which invariant and
which story they guard, and where the probe or the negative control is. Without
one of those, the test is decoration and the law stands - a test that has never
been observed to fail is not a test.

## Test doubles

Mock what you do not own and cannot run: a payment gateway, a third-party API.
Do not mock what you own - mocking your own code tests your assumptions about it
rather than it. A test that only asserts "this function was called" verifies
wiring, not behaviour, and will survive almost any bug.

## RED on a return: the story came back from GREEN or GATES

A test that turns out to be wrong sends the story back to RED. This is a
different RED from the first one, and treating it like the first one is how it
goes wrong.

**What triggers it.** The test asserts the wrong thing; it passes regardless of
whether the code is correct; it is too slow for the gate that runs it; it
depends on something the story does not own. Not: the test is inconvenient, or
the implementation turned out harder than expected. Those are GREEN's problem.

**Your remit is the defective test and nothing else.** The source already exists
and is usually correct. The phase lock freezes it again, which is right - do not
read that as a signal to change phase. Do not "tidy" the implementation while
you are here; do not add tests for behaviour the story never claimed.

**"Watch it fail" cannot apply, so it is replaced, not waived.** The thing whose
absence would make the corrected test fail is no longer absent, so the corrected
assertion is green the moment you write it - and stays green forever, whether or
not it asserts anything. A corrected test that has not been observed to fail is
not yet a test, exactly as the law says; the only difference is which mechanism
discharges it. One of these two, before the phase ends:

- **Probe it.** Mutate the *specific* production behaviour the test claims to
  pin - not any nearby line - watch that one assertion go red, revert, and
  confirm `git diff` is clean. Prefer this. It costs a minute, and a mutation
  that produces one failure with the right name is proof the assertion
  discriminates rather than merely passes. `check-boundaries.sh` refuses a PR
  whose `## Regressions` section describes a failure without showing one.
- **Measure it**, where the defect was cost rather than correctness - a test too
  slow for its timeout. Before and after, taken **under the gate command**, not
  the plain test command. The plain one is the fast one; it is the reason the
  defect was invisible in the first place.

Either goes in the story's `## Regressions` section, with the numbers or the
red output, not a description of them.

**GREEN afterwards may legitimately be a no-op.** If the source is untouched and
the corrected tests pass, that is the correct outcome and the orchestrator
verifies it by running the suite and `gates.sh --fast`. Nobody dispatches an
implementer to do nothing; an agent given no work will find some.
