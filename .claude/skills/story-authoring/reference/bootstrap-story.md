# The bootstrap story

Every project's first story. It turns an empty repository into the chosen
stack's real layout, and it is the only story that legitimately writes source
without tests first - which is why it uses the SCAFFOLD phase.

## Acceptance criteria for a bootstrap story

Phrase them as things that must be true of the repository, each verifiable by
running a command:

- **AC-1** - `bash scripts/gates.sh --gate lint` runs the project linter and
  passes on the scaffolded code.
- **AC-2** - `bash scripts/gates.sh --gate unit` runs the test runner, which
  discovers and passes one real example test.
- **AC-3** - `bash scripts/gates.sh --gate coverage` reports coverage and fails
  below the configured threshold.
- **AC-4** - `bash scripts/gates.sh --gate build` produces a runnable artefact.
- **AC-5** - `bash scripts/task.sh dev` starts the application locally.
- **AC-6** - `.claude/harness/project.conf` has a command for every required
  gate, and `BOOTSTRAPPED=yes`.
- **AC-7** - `.claude/harness/paths.conf` classifies this stack's test files as
  `test` and its build configuration as `config`.
- **AC-8** - `bash scripts/gates.sh --audit` passes: every required gate has a
  command, an existing `cwd`, and an `evidence` line.
- **AC-9** - Each required gate has been observed to fail. Moving the test
  directory aside makes the `unit` gate fail; putting it back makes it pass.

## What it must deliver

- the directory layout the stack expects, with a real entry point
- dependency manifests with pinned versions matching `docs/wiki/stack.md`
- the test runner configured, with one example test that genuinely runs
- linter, formatter and type checker configured
- a `.gitignore` for the ecosystem, and `.dockerignore` if containerised - both
  excluding `.claude/`, `docs/` and `scripts/` from production images
- `project.conf` filled in, with an `evidence` line per gate, and
  `BOOTSTRAPPED=yes`
- a `## Gate probes` section recording each gate observed failing
- a `## Scaffold inventory` naming every production file written and, for
  anything with behaviour, the test that covers it. SCAFFOLD is the one phase
  where nothing forces a test to exist first; this is where you show you wrote
  them anyway. `check-boundaries.sh` refuses the PR if a changed source file is
  missing from it.

## Sizing

The one-cycle rule in `CLAUDE.md` is framed around RED→GREEN and says nothing
about SCAFFOLD, which is where over-sizing costs the most: the story every
other story depends on, done in one pass, with no test forcing any of it.

A bootstrap story is **the toolchain and the gates, green on a walking
skeleton** - and nothing else. Eight or nine criteria, the ones listed above.
Anything project-specific that the plan wants at the start - a colour-palette
validator, a benchmark runner, an architectural-boundary lint rule - is its own
story, run through RED→GREEN like everything else, *after* bootstrap has
landed. It will get a failing test first that way, which is the whole reason
the harness exists. If the bootstrap story's criteria run past AC-10, or its
inventory past a couple of dozen files, split it there.

## Verifying it

Do not accept the story on the strength of the files existing. Run every gate
and the dev task yourself. A bootstrap story that lands with a wrong test
command poisons every story after it, because the next agent will trust
`project.conf` without re-deriving it.

**Do not trust a gate that passed.** The gate commands arrive from
`docs/wiki/stack.md`, which is researched and unexecuted by construction; this
story is where they are executed for the first time. A gate that passes quickly
and quietly is the thing to be suspicious of, because a command that does no
work exits 0 too. `cargo test` at a workspace root, `mypy` over a target that
resolves empty and a linter aimed at a moved directory all pass while testing
nothing.

So for each required gate, run it, then break what it guards and run it again:

    bash scripts/gates.sh --gate unit     # passes
    mv tests tests.probe && bash scripts/gates.sh --gate unit   # must fail
    mv tests.probe tests

Paste both outputs into `## Gate probes`. That is what turns a list of
researched command lines into gates, and it is the only work in this story that
cannot be redone cheaply later.
