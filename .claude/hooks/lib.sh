# --- Shell command text -----------------------------------------------------
#
# The Bash branch of the phase guard extracts write targets from a command
# STRING, with grep and awk, which know nothing about shell quoting. Left to
# themselves they read the inside of a quoted argument as syntax: the `|`
# delimiters in `sed -i 's|a|b|' f.txt` truncate the match so the target looks
# like `s`, and the `>` in `awk '/RED -> GREEN/' story.md` looks like a
# redirect. Both were observed blocking correct commands, one of which wrote
# nothing at all. A lock with false positives teaches the agent that blocks are
# noise, which is the exact instinct the lock exists to suppress.
#
# mask_shell_quotes rewrites every operator and whitespace character that is
# inside a quoted span, inside a heredoc body, or escaped by a backslash, into
# a control character. Such a span then survives extraction as one opaque token
# containing no operators, so the extractors see the command's structure and
# not its data. The mapping is reversible: a candidate that genuinely came from
# a quoted argument - `> "my file.ts"` - is restored by unmask_shell_quotes
# before it is classified.
#
#   |  -> \001   &  -> \002   ;  -> \003   >  -> \004
#   <  -> \005   SP -> \006   TAB-> \007   LF -> \010
#
# Control characters are used because no real command line contains them, so
# the round trip cannot corrupt a path that had one of them already.

# have named `=`, `[^` and a backquoted word as the path they were protecting;

# gates are stale" from "the gates ran and then something regenerated".
#
# The naive version - `find -newer` over the worktree - counts the gates' own
# exhaust as a change. A coverage report, a build directory, a bundler cache:
# all of them are written BY the gate run, all of them are gitignored, and any
# ad-hoc verification run afterwards recreates them. The Stop hook then blocks
# on `coverage/base.css` with a clean `git status`, which punishes exactly the
# extra verification the harness spends the rest of its documentation asking
# for. Observed in the field, twice.
#
# The set that matters is already defined: it is the one gate_tree_hash covers
# - see gated_stdin - never docs, vendor or ignored. So the question this asks
# is precisely "would the recorded gate hash still match", and the two answers
# cannot drift apart.
#
# Ignored TOP-LEVEL directories are pruned before the walk rather than filtered
# after it, because `src-tauri/target` holds six figures of files and a Stop

# --- What the gates judge ---------------------------------------------------
#
# gated_stdin   Reads "<category>\t<path>" lines, as classify_stdin prints
# them, and keeps the ones some gate could actually read. This is the ONE
# definition of "the code the gates ran against": gate_tree_hash records it,
# check-boundaries.sh recomputes it, and the Stop hook asks whether it moved.
# Three readers of one predicate cannot disagree; three predicates would.
#
# Kept: source, test, config, and harness - the hooks, the scripts, the gate
# manifest, the CI workflow. Dropped: docs (the story file that records the
# hash cannot be part of it), vendor, ignored, harness runtime state, and
# harness MARKDOWN. That last one is deliberate. A command file, an agent
# spec, a skill and CLAUDE.md classify as harness because they live under
# .claude/, but they are prompts: no lint, no test and no build reads them.
# Counting them meant rewording /advance-story cost a full gate run while
# editing a wiki page one directory over cost nothing, and it meant a
# recorded gate hash went stale on a change the gates could not have judged.
