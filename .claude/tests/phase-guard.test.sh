# Two halves, and the first is the one that matters:
#
#   * Commands that must NOT be blocked. A lock with false positives teaches
#     the agent that blocks are noise, which is precisely the instinct law 5
#     of CLAUDE.md exists to suppress. Every case here was a real block
#     observed in a real session, or is one quoting away from being one.
#   * Commands that MUST be blocked, asserted on the path the guard reports -
#     not merely on the fact that something was blocked. A guard that refuses
#     `sed -i 's|a|b|' src/main.ts` because it thinks the path is `s` is
#     right by accident and will be wrong the next time.
