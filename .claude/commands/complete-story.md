Story: $1

Current harness state:
!`bash scripts/phase.sh show`

Act as the **lead-po** orchestrator and run this story through every phase to
REVIEW without stopping for approval between phases. Follow exactly the same
per-phase procedure as `/advance-story` — the phases, the dispatches, the
verification and the rules are identical. The only difference is that you keep
going.

Two steps in that procedure are ordered for a reason, and running without
approval between phases is exactly when they get quietly reordered:

- **RED and GREEN each end with `bash scripts/gates.sh --fast`.** Not for a
  pass — in RED the test gates should be red — but to see whether the tests are
  admissible to the gates that will judge them. The coverage gate runs the same
  tests instrumented, which is slower than the test command and slower again on
  CI. A suite can pass RED, pass GREEN, pass every local gate, and still fail a
  required gate in CI on a timeout nobody measured.
- **GATES → REVIEW sets the phase before committing**, then runs
  `bash scripts/check-boundaries.sh`, then pushes and opens the PR.
  `check-boundaries.sh` reads the phase out of the *committed* frontmatter, so
  a commit made while the story still says `phase: GATES` is one CI rejects —
  intermittently, depending on when that job runs, which is worse than always.

- **A return to RED ends with pasted red, not with a note saying it went red.**
  A corrected test runs for the first time against code that already satisfies
  it, so it passes immediately and forever; the Test Developer earns it by
  mutating the specific behaviour it pins, watching that assertion fail,
  reverting, and pasting the output into `## Regressions`. `check-boundaries.sh`
  refuses the PR otherwise. GREEN on re-entry may legitimately be a no-op you
  verify yourself rather than delegate.
- **GREEN confirms the negative-control values RED recorded**, not just that
  the control tests pass. RED could not run them: its suite failed at import.
- **A claim that the contract is wrong is reproduced before it is accepted.**
  When a subagent reports that an acceptance criterion, a threshold or a frozen
  test is wrong, verify it yourself on different inputs, without reusing the
  subagent's code, and record the reproduction in the story. Running unattended
  is exactly when this gets skipped, and it is the difference between a correct
  escalation and a plausible excuse for not failing.
- **A mutation table in the handoff is a claim until you run one.** When RED
  says the suite discriminates, pick a mutation it predicts a count for — the
  one whose predicted catch is a single assertion, for preference — run it
  against the committed implementation, compare the count, restore the file
  byte-for-byte and confirm green. Unattended is when this gets skipped too.
- **PLANNED → RED names the required gate that would fail if the artifact
  broke.** If only an optional gate can, `required_gates` gets it before the
  phase moves. Every required gate once passed over a story none of them had
  exercised.

Stop and ask the user only when:

- an acceptance criterion is ambiguous and the readings lead to different code;
- a required gate fails in a way that needs a product decision;
- the tests turn out to be wrong, so the story must return to RED;
- the story is bigger than one cycle and needs splitting;
- something outside the story is broken and fixing it would exceed this scope.

Never resolve one of those by guessing in order to keep the loop running.

Between phases, state in one line which phase you are entering and why the
previous one is genuinely complete — with the command output that proves it, not
an assertion that it passed.

At the end, report: the PR link, every acceptance criterion with the test that
covers it, the full gate summary, anything you deliberately left out, and the
next story you recommend.
