//! MC-018, AC-1 to AC-6: the calibration corpus is well formed.
//!
//! Twenty-eight real screenshots in `fixtures/corpus/` with a hand-marked
//! expected crop for each. These tests check that the corpus is *usable* -
//! every file present and decodable, every rectangle inside its image, the tag
//! vocabulary covered, the whole set small enough to clone. They do **not**
//! check that a rectangle is the right rectangle; no code can, and MC-019's
//! guidance is explicit that a reported clip may be a mis-marked rect rather
//! than a detector fault.
//!
//! Not `#[ignore]`d: these run in the `unit` gate on every commit, because a
//! corpus that has quietly rotted - a file renamed, an image replaced with a
//! different size - turns MC-019 into a test that measures nothing and says so
//! in a way nobody can read.
//!
//! # What is settled, what is mechanical
//!
//! * **Settled elsewhere, read out rather than re-derived**: the nine required
//!   tags and the 60 MB ceiling, both from MC-018's acceptance criteria; the
//!   twenty-entry floor; the WebP container layout, which AC-6 reads out of
//!   the file's own bytes.
//! * **Mechanical**: everything else. Exact counts, exact bounds, exact byte
//!   comparisons.
//!
//! # Why AC-6 reads the RIFF header itself
//!
//! Nothing in this workspace can *write* a lossy WebP (`image` 0.25 encodes
//! `VP8L` and nothing else), which is why MC-009's AC-3 was deferred to this
//! story: the corpus is where a real one arrives. "Is this lossy" therefore
//! has to be answered from the container, not from a decoder - a decoder
//! happily reads both and tells you nothing about which it read.

// Included directly rather than through `common/mod.rs`. The app crate reaches
// that module with `#[path]`, so declaring the loader there would compile it -
// and its `serde` dependency - into test binaries that have no use for either.
